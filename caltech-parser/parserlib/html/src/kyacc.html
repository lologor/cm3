LY_BEGIN(yacc, kyacc, parser, MyLangParse, Parser,y)

A _IT(parser specification) is a file with the _TT(.y) suffix which
specifies an LR(1) grammar (LR(1) includes LALR(1) grammars; see
_LN(lr.html,LR(1) versus LALR(1)))
for which a parser interface is to be generated.

The specification is given as a list of BNF grammar rules
. Unlike UNIX Yacc, each reduction rule
is associated with a _IT(reduction method), which must be given a name.

Each line of the file must have one of the following forms:
<P>

<TABLE>

_TR(returnType:)
Declare grammar symbol _TT(returnType), and the Modula-3 type
_TT(returnType), which will be returned by any of the following
reduction methods.
_TRE

_A(reducmeth)
_TR(ruleName sym1 'c')
Declare a reduction method which reduces _TT(sym1) followed by _Q(c)
to the last declared symbol _TT(returnType).
_TRE

_TRP(%left sym1
%right ruleName_returnType
%nonassoc sym2)
assign left associativity to any rules containing the symbol
_TT(sym1), and assign a
higher precedence and right associativity to the rule named
_TT(ruleName) with return type _TT(returnType). Assign still higher
precedence to any rules containing
the symbol _TT(sym2), but still warn of any shift/reduce conflicts.
_TRE

_TRP(%start sym1 sym2)
declare types _TT(sym1) and _TT(sym2) as subtypes of
_TT(StartType) (see below).
_TRE

</TABLE>
<P>

If a precedence is assigned to a rule using _TT(ruleName_returnType),
then any precedence assigned to that rule by assigning precedence to
one of its symbols is overridden. Each symbol can be assigned only one
precedence; hence if for example two rules (involving binary and unary
minus) must have different precedences, then only one can be assigned
a precedence by assigning a precedence to the _TT('-') symbol.
<P>

The set of valid grammar symbols consists of whatever tokens were
declared in the _TI, plus whatever reduction method return types are
declared as above.
<P>

The reduction method names have the form _TT(ruleName_returnType);
_EXT expects the methods to have these names. To avoid Modula-3 name
conflicts, parse types should not contain underscores.

_A(intf)_H(parser interface)

A _IT(parser interface) is a Modula-3 interface defining a type _TT(T)
representing a parser. Additionally the following types are declared:

_C(_TT(StartType <: MyLangTok.ParseType)<BR>
_TT(_TT(OtherType <: MyLangTok.ParseType)))

and all reduction method return types are declared as subtypes of either
_TT(StartType) or _TT(OtherType). Hence all _TT(ParseType)s of
importance (i.e. those appearing as parameters in reduction methods) are
either _TT(StartType)s, _TT(OtherType)s, or _TT(MyLangTok.Token)s.
<P>

In addition to the reduction methods, the parser type _TT(T) also
generically contains the following:

<PRE>
  METHODS
    setLex(lex: MyLangTok.Lexer): T;
    parse(exhaustInput: BOOLEAN := TRUE): StartType;
</PRE>

A generated parser is initialized as often as necessary
by calling its _TT(setLex) method, with a
_LN(ktok.html#compat,compatible) lexer given as an argument.
There is no method named _TT(init), to allow
customized initialization parameters in extended lexers.
<P>

_A(exhaust)
If _TT(parse) is called with _TT(exhaustInput = FALSE), then the
parser will continue reading tokens until reading another token would cause
a syntax error (this may or may not require peeking ahead one
token. If peeking is required and the last token would cause an error,
it calls _TT(lex.unget())). It returns the _TT(StartType) representing
everything up to just before the error. This feature is useful for
parsing a language block whose end is delimited by some token not
meaningful in that language, such as an unmatched _TT('}').
