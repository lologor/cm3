(* A Value.T is a representation for a Modula-3 value; it is intended 
   to be used in conjunction with the typed Abstract Syntax Tree 
   interface, TypedAST.  A Value.T only contains enough information 
   to determine the value if you already know the value's type; 
   therefore Value.T's should generally be paired with Type.T's. 
   
   For good measue, this interface also defines types to represent 
   procedures and exceptions. *)

       note that this declaration has changed from what's in the SRC
       code, because 
       (1) AstToValue doesn't have enough information to generate the 
           old format
       (2) The old format can grow exponentially with the program text
           (TYPE S = SET OF [0..1024*1024]), whereas this version only 
           grows linearly with the program text.
